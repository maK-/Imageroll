--Imageroll--

This is just a repository for some of the classes I wrote, 
to be used in my Imageroll project.

The project is located here.

What is Imageroll?

It's a small site I made that allows Image sharing with a twist.
None of the images are stored on the site and each image only gets
60 seconds for everyone to see. There is no registration, all that 
is required is a nickname to upload an image to the Queue. 
There is also a chat window to discuss the images.
	
	-Easy Image sharing
	-Simple Chat window
	-All users see a single image for 60 seconds.
	-PHP / Javascript / MYSQL


Apologies for stuff I left out...
The remainder is just the timer + database interaction!
